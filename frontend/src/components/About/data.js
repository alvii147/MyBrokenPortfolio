    bio: `
        Hi, I'm Zahin! I'm a 3rd year student at the University of Waterloo,
        pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering
        and a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.
        I'm currently seeking 4-month co-op opportunities for Winter 2022.
        I am often engaged in exploring various domains of software development,
        notably web development, data science and computer vision.
        I am experienced in building Python and Django-based backend web applications,
        as well as in experimenting with machine learning algorithms and training neural networks.
        I'm also proficient in software development processes,
        such as version control, CI-CD and test-driven development.
        Besides coding, I also enjoy playing soccer and chess.
